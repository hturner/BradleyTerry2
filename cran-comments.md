## General comments

This is a minor update to be compatible with qvcalc 0.9-1, which is being
submitted to CRAN at the same time. The CRAN version of BradleyTerry2 (1.0-7)
will still pass check with qvcalc 0.9-1, but the new version of qvcalc reveals
a bug in BradleyTerry2 1.0-7 which is fixed in this update.
