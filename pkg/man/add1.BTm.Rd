\title{Add or Drop Single Terms to/from a Bradley Terry Model}
\usage{
\method{add1}{BTm}(object, scope, scale = 0, test = c("none", "Chisq", "F"),
  x = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class inheriting from \code{"BTm"}.}

\item{scope}{a formula specifying the model including all terms to be
considered for adding or dropping.}

\item{scale}{an estimate of the dispersion. Not implemented for models with
random effects.}

\item{test}{should a p-value be returned? The F test is only appropriate for
models with no random effects for which the dispersion has been estimated.
The Chisq test is a likelihood ratio test for models with no random effects,
otherwise a Wald test.}

\item{x}{a model matrix containing columns for all terms in the scope.
Useful if \code{add1} is to be called repeatedly.  \strong{Warning:} no checks
are done on its validity.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{\link[=add1.glm]{add1.glm()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"anova"} summarizing the differences in fit
between the models.
}
\description{
Add or drop single terms within the limit specified by the \code{scope}
argument. For models with no random effects, compute an analysis of deviance
table, otherwise compute the Wald statistic of the parameters that have been
added to or dropped from the model.
}
\details{
The hierarchy is respected when considering terms to be added or dropped:
all main effects contained in a second-order interaction must remain, and so
on.

In a scope formula \samp{.} means \sQuote{what is already there}.

For \code{drop1}, a missing \code{scope} is taken to mean that all terms in
the model may be considered for dropping.

If \code{scope} includes player covariates and there are players with
missing values over these covariates, then a separate ability will be
estimated for these players in \emph{all} fitted models. Similarly if there
are missing values in any contest-level variables in \code{scope}, the
corresponding contests will be omitted from all models.

If \code{formula} includes random effects, the same random effects structure
will apply to all models.

\examples{

result <- rep(1, nrow(flatlizards$contests))
BTmodel1 <- BTm(result, winner, loser,
                ~ throat.PC1[..] + throat.PC3[..] + (1|..),
                data = flatlizards,
                tol = 1e-4, sigma = 2, trace = TRUE)

drop1(BTmodel1)

add1(BTmodel1, ~ . + head.length[..] + SVL[..], test = "Chisq")

BTmodel2 <- update(BTmodel1, formula = ~ . + head.length[..])

drop1(BTmodel2, test = "Chisq")
